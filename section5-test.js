// Test 1 : Frequency Counter - sameFrequency
// write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.
// solution must have the following complexities - Time:O(n)
// ex) sameFrequency(182,281) // true. sameFrequency(34,14) //false
